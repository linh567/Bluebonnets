                <div class="answer">A series of events from the past year brought me here today. In Spring 2025, I
                    studied abroad in Singapore, where I met fellow Longhorns and international students. For the first
                    two years, I had pigeonholed myself in the engineering circle—I even thought there were only three
                    UT students abroad in Singapore, when there were 27 of us! I just hadn’t considered the other
                    non-engineering programs. Around that time, I was also reading Everything I Know About...</div>

                <div class="answer">When we think of leadership, our minds go to big heroic acts: spearhead a massive
                    project, leading a team of X people. But, I think leadership presents itself in smaller acts as
                    well–initiative, supporting others, and knowing when to step back and let your group shine. I've
                    always gravitated toward...

                    for autonomous systems. I stumbled upon robotics my freshman year of college when my friend asked me
                    to join a competition with her. At this point, I had zero idea what I was doing. I was an art kid in

                    retire and a good number of them have given this as their answer. Also, all those reels about the

                    Someone told me this when I was really worried the research labs I wanted to work for wouldn’t
                    accept me because I lacked experience, but I think it applies to everything! I use it as a reminder
                    to show up as myself no matter where I am because that’s the only way people can truly connect with
                    you</div>

                    of high school, I used all the money I earned working as a barista to travel to Honolulu with my
                    coworkers. It’s one of my best memories, so I’m always reminded of it when I’m in a great mood!
